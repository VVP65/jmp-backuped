[Chorus: Jamie Irrepressible]
Here she comes again
Troubles on her brow
Here she comes again
With worries she can't hide

[Verse 1: Jamie Irrepressible]
Who can stop the rain
Pouring down inside?
Who can keep her sane
Give her peace of mind?

[Chorus - Variation: Jamie Irrepressible]
Here she comes again
Covered up in black
Such a pretty face
Such sorrow in her eyes
