Here she comes again

[Chorus: Jamie Irrepressible]
Here she comes again
Troubles on her brow
Here she comes again
With worries she can't hide

[Verse 1: Jamie Irrepressible]
Who can stop the rain
Pouring down inside?
Who can keep her sane
Give her peace of mind?

[Chorus - Variation: Jamie Irrepressible]
Here she comes again
Covered up in black
Such a pretty face
Such sorrow in her eyes

[Verse 2: Jamie Irrepressible]
Do you wanna know
What's killing her inside?
Do you dare to walk
The alleys of her mind?

[Chorus: Jamie Irrepressible]
Here she comes again
Troubles on her brow
Here she comes again
With worries she can't hide

[Outro: Jamie Irrepressible]
Will you let it show?
Will you cross the line?
Will you take her home
And tell her she'll be fine?

(Uh uh uh)...
